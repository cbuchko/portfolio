        Since September 2022, my sole focus has been my Full Stack Developer
        position at Hummingbird Drones. It's been an incredible learning
        experience transforming the Nova platform from a proof of concept to a
        widely adopted application.
      </h5>
      <h4>What is Nova?</h4>
      <h5>
        Nova is a web based GIS platform for emergency response crews that have
        drone mapping or data processing workflows. One of the use cases is
        Wildfire Intellegience. Wildfire crews fly drones over their fires, they
        gather infrared data, and these images can be inspected to find
        Hotspots. With Nova, crew members can upload all their images and our
        machine learning algorithm identifies all Hotspots in minutes. From
        there, a user can annotate the outputs and distribute it to their team.
        Nova transforms processes that were manual and time-consuming into
        automated bliss.
