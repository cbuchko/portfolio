    - More aesthetic score (ticks up)
    - Mouse trail
    - Pads disappear instantly and the score lingers for a bit


Brain Scan:
    - People aren't understanding what they need to do right away
    - Health bar is too similar to fingerprint
    - Not enough positive feedback for staying in the zone
    - It's unclear that you need to wait it out

Papers Please:
    - When other characters are added, make them show in every iteration, so you cant brute force

"Feel" Ideas:
    - Bespoke Zodiac Selector
    - Aquarium add sfx and ocean elements

Clean up SSO stuff when I know I'm done with it

Responsiveness Notes:
General: In general the app doesn't support a small enough width
    Biometric: Finger scanner seems to activate on click not on hold, beginning scan is misplaced
    Brain Scan: Similar to biometric, seems to only works on click
    Shopping Cart: No ghost drag item
    Fishing: Needs a spacebar replacement
    Undertale: Needs a WASD replacement
