Feedback actionables:
Trim soudns like success so there isnt dead air beginning and end
DO A FULL SFX PASS FOR TRIMMING
Self Checkouts gotta go
Brain Scan clearer UI for health bar


Levels that NEED to be better:
Self Checkout - missing sauce
              - make it more skillbased? have to order things by weight?
Spotify 
    - More aesthetic score (ticks up)
    - Mouse trail
    - Pads disappear instantly and the score lingers for a bit


Brain Scan:
    - People aren't understanding what they need to do right away
    - Health bar is too similar to fingerprint
    - Not enough positive feedback for staying in the zone
    - It's unclear that you need to wait it out

Papers Please:
    - When other characters are added, make them show in every iteration, so you cant brute force

"Feel" Ideas:
    - Bespoke Zodiac Selector
    - Aquarium add sfx and ocean elements

Clean up SSO stuff when I know I'm done with it
