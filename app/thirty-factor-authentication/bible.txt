Levels that NEED to be better:
Self Checkout - missing sauce
Spotify 
    - More aesthetic score
    - Pad spawns are too random and not smart enough. Pads should never spawn ontop of eachother
    - Music probably could be lined up better
    - Move to Grid system for spawning?

Vowel Counter - This one just stands out as under baked
