Survivor 42 was one of the best seasons in a long time, and ever since then I've been patiently waiting for Survivor 43. Well, the wait is almost over, and I'm thrilled to be back with predictions. Survivor 42 proved that the new format can work, and can work really well. The question still holds, can the Survivor crew repeat 42's success? Because I am nervous that 43 will be closer to 41 than 42. But I have faith, especially when looking at this cast.

There are some hilariously unique characters on this cast. And some super fans that definitely give me a run for my money. This seems like a group of people that are all willing to do whatever it takes to win. I think there'll be some brutal betrayals. And like any season, there are some people that are doomed to fail, and others I think have a real shot at winning. Let's talk about that.

## Zero Chancers

I've said it before and I'll say it again, a 19 year old is never winning Survivor. Sorry Sami, you seem like a nice guy, but you've got no life experience. And it doesn't help that he's coming in with a cocky, "of course I'm gonna win attitude". I think he could be fun to watch, but nobody's handing a kid a million dollar cheque.

Geo's pre-game interviews are hard to watch. The guy is clearly coming into Survivor with a chip on his shoulder. He talks about how he had to quit his job and how much he's sacrificed. He seems hellbent on making huge moves and becoming a game changer. Geo is going to play himself out of the game, and it will be hilarious.

## Long Shots

Dwight's an insanely smart guy. He's accomplished a ton for a 22 year old. But I'm not confident in his social skills. The way he talks and the answers he gives, I don't know if he will be able to make the bonds necessary. There's definitely opportunity for him to prove me wrong, but he comes off as a robot to me.

Noelle's interesting. She has a great story, a story we are probably going to hear a lot of this season. Being an amputee is a very uniquely compelling trait. But of course, nobody will let her get to the end due to fearing the sympathy vote. And also she just doesn't seem very savvy. Her interview answers are boring, generic and make me nervous about her gameplay.

## Dark Horses

Predicting Cody so high is definitely a stab in the dark from me. He'll be a challenge beast without a doubt. But I'm also predicting a more loveable, carefree side from him. I think his tribe will like him a lot, and he will easily coast to the merge. My question with Cody is whether he can navigate the merge. If he can break from his archetype and not be labelled a threat, Cody might win.

Elie and Jeanine are similar to me. They are both very prototypical Survivor players. I bet the CBS crew would love to have someone like them every season. They seem to have everything it takes, and will definitely go far. But I just don't see that extra "oomph" needed to win it all. If they find that "oomph", I could see either of them winning. But for right now I think they'll just be average players.

## Winner Contenders

In contrast to the last two seasons, I have a lot of people that I think could win.

When I talk about the "oomph" needed to win, I'm talking about Jesse. He has the "oomph" in spades. A fantastic story, such a serious drive to win, and he seems incredibly likeable. Similar to Noelle he will have trouble getting to the end with his story. But I see him as much more likely to get there in spite of that obstacle.

James just seems like an all around guy. Smart, sturdy, likeable. Not an obvious threat but willing to play a big game. No real x-factor with James here but he seems like a safe enough bet.

I love Cassidy, I really hope she goes far. She's just such a fun person to listen to and she's so passionate about the game. I'm nervous about how her personality will translate to the game. I feel like she has high variance. She might dominate or flop. I'm betting on dominate, hope I'm not wrong.

Owen is this seasons Ricard and Hai, in the sense that he has everything going for him. He is a threat in every sense. And like Hai and Ricard, I'm worried he'll get sniped for being too obvious. But unlike Hai and Ricard, Owen seems to not have a huge ego. Owen will be much better at subduing his threat level and laying low. Hopefully. If not he goes home in 6th place.

And for my winner pick, it's Justine. I honestly don't have a ton of reason for it either. A lot of people have points against them, and Justine doesn't have any. She has an undeniable passion for the game, she won't be a liability and she has clear people skills. In her interviews she talks about wanting to be underestimated. If she doesn't change her mind on that, she has a great path to the end. Are we looking at the next Kim Spradlin? I think so.

Here is my final ranking:

#### Contenders
1. Justine
2. Owen
3. James
4. Cassidy
5. Jesse

8. Elie
