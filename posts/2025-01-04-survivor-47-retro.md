The last time I posted was the Survivor 47 prediction post in September. That was before the season started, and now it’s over. This isn’t my regular posting cadence, and I don’t want my lack of updates to reflect negatively on the season. Survivor 47 was fantastic—I almost have no notes.

First off, I need to get something off my chest. I’m officially a New Era fanboy. CBS figured it out. I didn’t think they could, but Survivor fucking slaps lately. I’m still mostly convinced it’s due to the 90-minute episodes, but who cares? We’re eating good these days. I genuinely think this stretch of seasons will be looked back on as some of Survivor’s best.

Survivor 47 will be remembered for its strategy. This was easily the most competitive season of the New Era. It’s extremely rare that every alliance, whether they have power or not, could be justifiably pegged as playing the best game. Rachel, Genevieve, Caroline, Sam, Andy, and Gabe all clearly came to win. These players would dog walk casts from weaker seasons.

The winning mentality led to a distinct vibe for the New Era. In an age where seasons can sometimes feel too wholesome and kumbaya, Survivor 47 was refreshingly cutthroat. Just think back to Anika’s jaw-dropping blindside—that’s the good stuff, that’s what I want to see. I want to watch people who will do anything to win, not just those who are happy for the experience.

Rachel was one of my favorites from the start. What a compelling and sweet human being. Watching her scrap her way to a well-deserved victory was a great bookend to the season. I think Rachel’s win isn’t necessarily impressive in the sense that she was immune for, like, five votes, but she was clearly a great player. Her need to win out was a result of her stiff competition.

The yin to Survivor 47’s yang is that a season full of strategic players often lacks iconic characters. I would say that holds true here. Nobody on 47 really comes close to being a favorite for me. I loved Andy, Sam, Rachel, and Genevieve, but even for the New Era, do they really compare to Q, Emily, Yam Yam, and Cody? That’s the season’s flaw for me.

Obviously, this is a delicate balance. Survivor 46 was the opposite: all drama and character, with really bad gameplay. In 47, we got Operation Italy, successful idol plays, tight gameplay, and a satisfying winner. Somewhere in between lies the perfect season of Survivor. Personally, I watch Survivor for the characters rather than the gameplay, but Survivor is Survivor, and 47 was really good Survivor.
