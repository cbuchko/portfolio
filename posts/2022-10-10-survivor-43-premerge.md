Three episodes into Survivor 43, it's about time I spoke about it. So far it's a lot of fun. A couple of top tier characters, some hilarious moments, and a lot of potential for great game play. I love the new beware advantage with the beads, way better than the phrases. Overall, the season is good, not amazing. Nothing to make me obsess over it yet. But a lot of times a predictable pre-merge can lead to an amazing post-merge. There's still a lot of Survivor left.

I have to start by talking about my winner pick being voted out second. Turns out I was really, really wrong about Justine. I was expecting her to be much more likeable, and just, not oblivious. She was so bad that she got voted out despite being the tribes best challenge competitor. It didn't help that Cody had it out for her, but Justine really disappointed me.

Otherwise, Vesi is a really fun tribe. Cody is a top-tier Survivor character, everything he says is gold. Jesse is really wholesome and a great strategist. Dwight is fun to root for just because he's a young superfan. And Noelle is starting to grow on me. I don't think anyone on Vesi will win, but they definitely have the best characters. Jesse is gonna be a huge threat though.

Coco hasn't been to tribal, so of course we know nothing about them. Karla's been getting the most attention, with her being the tribes narrator and finding the beware advantage. They're obviously setting her up for bigger things, so she'll go far. Hard to say anything about anybody else. I still really like Cassidy, Lindsay and Ryan. Geo's coming off much chiller than I expected. Anyone could win in Coco.

Lastly, Baka is really funny to me. Nothing makes better TV than watching people think they're good at Survivor when they're not. Elie and Jeanine are hilariously bad. I never understand how players can form a tight alliance between two people and then assume they're running their tribe. Hello, wake up Elie and Jeanine, two is not the majority of five. They must think they have the guys in their pocket, but that's just so arrogant to assume.  And the stuff with Gabler... it's really bad gameplay.

The guys in Baka are awesome. Gabler brings a really refreshing presence to the show. Sami is my favourite person on the entire cast, tied with Cody. Sami is actually hilarious. And Owen is fun to watch because he's actually good at Survivor. Owen is the one running the tribe, regardless of what the girls think. I really hope Baka goes to tribal again and the guys dunk on the girls. That would be euphoric. 

At this point nobody jumps out as a clear winner. I think Jesse, Karla and Elie come off the most as main characters, but that usually means they don't win. I think those three are going to be really important to storylines but ultimately be blindsided. My tentative guess is it's leading to a Lindsay or Owen win.
