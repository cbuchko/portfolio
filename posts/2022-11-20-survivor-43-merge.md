Now in its final stretch, the fireworks in Survivor 43 are finally starting to go off. After a string of straightforward eliminations, the players are at the point where they're ready to make moves. Last episodes double boot was the best episode of the season, providing some raw drama and a great blindside on James. Now at the final eight, it's looking like it could be anyone's game. I can't remember the last time a season had this many contenders for the title.

Starting with the OG Vesi boys, Cody and Jesse have been this seasons dynamic duo. They've both been decision makers in every vote and they're never targets. It's actually crazy to me how they've faced no resistance. It's like they've been playing Survivor on easy mode. And the duo complements each other amazingly. Cody seems to bring the savoir-faire while Jesse is more of the brains. However, I think both of their days are numbered. Surely these other savvy players will catch on eventually and not let the boys run away with it.

Moving onto the remaining Baka, I'd say Gabler's the only one with truly no shot at this point. Sorry Gabler, you're fun to watch at least. Sami's been playing a solid game. If you asked me around merge time, he'd be one of my top choices. But the deeper it gets the more I feel like this season isn't Sami's story. He's a crucial narrator but I don't think we're building up to a Sami win. Owen however does have storyline going for him. Survivor loves their underdog winners and Owen has really come into his own recently. I think it's still an uphill battle for him because his positioning is still unstable, but Owen is up there for me.

Lastly, the Coco girls, Karla and Cassidy. Both have played stellar games so far. Karla's has been more pronounced, getting a lot of screen time and character moments. Whereas Cassidy has been playing a much lower key game. I think they're both chilling after James' elimination. Losing their biggest ally probably significantly lowered their threat levels. People will be eyeing the big boys before these girls. At least I think this is true for Cassidy, she will slip through for a while longer for sure.

Overall I'm enjoying this season so far. The cast, as always, has been a home run. I do think the gameplay has been a little safe and textbook, resulting in some "boring" episodes. You can't really fault the players for playing smart, I just wish the editing would focus more on camplife and survival if the gameplay is mundane. But I think the season is about to blast off. There's no easy votes left, which I hope will result in a great ending for this season.
