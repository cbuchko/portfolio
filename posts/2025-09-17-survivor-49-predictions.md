This will be the weirdest prediction post I've done. We know two of these people are returning for Survivor 50: Rizo and Savannah. I genuinely don't know how to structure my predictions with this information leaked. So let's just start by addressing it.

First let's talk about the man, the myth, the legend, the R-I-Z-G-O-D, RizGod baby. And guys, it pains me to say this, Rizo is really fucking cool. In his pre-season interviews he actually is extremely personable and likable. I'm sure the nickname is the only weird thing about him. This guy will emphasize the social game, ride the middle incredibly well, and goddamnit he is gonna be a Survivor icon.

For Savannah, she comes across as exactly the kind of person I would predict to do well. She has the fun, spunky, charismatic energy we've seen from winners like Kenzie and Dee. I traditionally really like these peoples chances. A high emphasis on the social game, and a archetype that stereotypically gets underestimated. Savannah also seems pretty devious from her interviews, which may bite her, but since we know she returns it probably won't.

Alright, let's proceed with the usual format.

## Zero Chancers

Annie has a laughably low chance of winning. I am so sorry, but, she literally claims to have no social game. She said she doesn't understand it. We applied to Survivor thinking we could win based off of physical strength and mental toughness alone? Girl...

Shannon is giving me subtle first boot vibes. Often the first boot doesn't seem to be a laughably bad Survivor player, but someone who is just "there". I think if red tribe loses early, Shannon will find herself in the minority. This is also kind of based off knowing Rizo and Savannah wouldn't be in danger.

## Long Shots

There's a lot of people this season I don't feel strongly about in one way or another. Winners pop. Winners stand-out. Sometimes I predict someone like Q because he pops so much. For 49, people like Sophi, Kristina, Nicole, and Nate just don't give me enough to go off of.

Jake could be a competent Survivor player. But he's really the only physically dominating person on the cast. Poor guy.

## Dark Horses

Jawan is such a vibe. What a cutesy lovable little goofball. He's the type of player people are gonna love having in their alliance. I worry about him not having a strategic foothold, and becoming a cog in the machine. Zero vote finalist? Maybe. But he's got the right vibe to win.

Matt is a lot of fun. When you're one of the older guys, you have to be fit and you have to be likable. Matt has both. Think Gabler or Mike Turner from 42.

## Winner Picks

Rizo and Savannah are both obvious winner picks. I don't claim any fame or fortune if they do win, but I gotta put them up here.

I'm also gonna put the two alternates who got the chance to play here. These two were originally not supposed to play, but were shoved in at the last moment. MC is really fun and really fit. She'll make merge easily, and then it's a matter of momentum. My only problem with MC is she is a really new fan. New fans tend to view Survivor as a strategy game and not a social game. Jason comes across as extremely unassuming and gives vibes like no other winner in the past. Guy is smart and I don't think will be targeted.

The last person to talk about is Steven. He's very charismatic with golden retriever energy. This guy has the X-factor. I really hope he finds a foothold early on and establishes some heavy trust. I think he'll be a huge jury threat, a strategic powerhouse, and a social butterfly. W Triple Threat. If we didn't have Season 50 spoilers, I would maybe make him my #1 pick.
